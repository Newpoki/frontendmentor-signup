## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For static types
-   [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

-   Saving colors as separated values but unusable values as of (e.g `'234, 29%, 20%'` instead of `'hsl(234, 29%, 20%')`) has the benefit of being able to tune the color alpha value easily.
